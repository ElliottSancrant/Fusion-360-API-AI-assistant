A palette can be displayed while the user runs commands and interacts with Fusion 360.  A palette is not even associated with a particular document.  When a palette is displayed it will remain displayed for the entire Fusion 360 session unless you or the user closes it.</td>\n",

Besides being used to speed up the processing of complex tasks, multiple threads are also very useful in interactive applications when you need to have background processing occurring but still want to allow the user to interact with the application. That's the big benefit of what's provided by the Fusion 360 API, as you'll see in the example below.</td>\n",

First, palettes are not associated with a command and do not have the same lifetime rules that a command has.  A palette can be displayed while the user runs commands and interacts with Fusion 360.  A palette is not even associated with a particular document.  When a palette is displayed it will remain displayed for the entire Fusion 360 session unless you or the user closes it.  \n",

       "7380  If you think of a thread as a sequence of instructions that are processed by the computer, multi-threading allows many threads to be processed simultaneously.  Besides being used to speed up the processing of complex tasks, multiple threads are also very useful in interactive applications when you need to have background processing occurring but still want to allow the user to interact with the application. That's the big benefit of what's provided by the Fusion 360 API, as you'll see in the example below.  \n",
